# Building University Management System Part-2

## 12-1 Avoid Repetition of Try-Catch , use catchAsync

### Higher Order Function

- A Function That Takes a function, do some task and return a function

- This is used to keep the code base clean
- Reduces repetitive functions
- Here Typescript comes with a solution named as functional typescript

- Express gives a request handler to deal with it and helps typescript

```ts
const createStudent: RequestHandler = async (req, res, next) => {};
```

- no need to define like req:Request

#### Ending an Era of Try Catch byy Using Higher Order function

```ts
const catchAsync = (fn: RequestHandler) => {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch((err) => next(err));
  };
};
// for getting all students
const getAllStudents = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  const result = await StudentServices.getAllStudentsFromDB();
  sendResponse(res, {
    statusCode: httpStatus.OK,
    success: true,
    message: 'Students are retrieved successfully',
    data: result,
  });
});
```
